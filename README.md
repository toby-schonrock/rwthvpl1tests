Tests for week1 vpl assignments for RWTH Betriebssysteme und Systemsoftware

As we all know there where several issues with the assignment for week 1 of VPL:
1. Unclear specification
1. Unclear test output
1. Missing files (eg doubly_linked_list.h) that prevented easily compilation locally 
1. ~~VPL~~

This project attempts to amend that by allowing:
2. Local compilation
2. Use of your preffered IDE
2. Use of static analysers
2. Hopefully clear and thorough tests

To use :
3. Pull the project with the option "--recurse-submodules"
3. Copy your implementations into the appropriate .c files in the src directory
3. run ./runtests.sh

Note: this is currently intended to be run on linux systems only
Note: I have attempted to keep the code "spoiler free" meaning no generic solutions should be found in the testing code
Feel free to contribute ~~and show the bus team what an assignment should look like~~
